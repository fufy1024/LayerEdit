# LayerEdit (AAAI-2026)
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper [LayerEdit: Disentangled Multi-Object Editing via Conflict-Aware Multi-Layer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08251).




## ToDo
- [ ] **Release Inference Code.**
- [ ] **Release inference code that combines grounding-sam (more accurate segmentation, but potentially slower, and at the same time, grounding-sam has no reasoning ability).**
